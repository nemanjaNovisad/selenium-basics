Why do we need Xpath and CSS Selector?
-developers may not provide all the locators in html.
-by using  xpath and css  we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
-xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements
uniquely on the web page

Types of Xpath:
Absolute Xpath -> starts from the starting node of the html
                    it always starts with single slash (/)
                    e.g /html/body/div/div/div

Relative Xpath ->  starts from any node in html
                    it always starts with double slash (//)

Syntax for relative xpath:
//tagname[@attribute = '']

e.g.  //input[@id = 'email']

Identifying elements by its text:
//tagname[text() = 'text value']

e.g.  //a[text() = 'Create new account']
//h2[text() = 'Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life.']

identifying elements by using contains method:
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

e.g.  //input[contains(@placeholder, 'Email')]
//h2[contains(text(), 'the world')]

starts-with will identify elements by its partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]

e.g. //input[starts-with(@aria-label, 'Email')]

Advanced Xpath:
is based on parent and child, sibling relationship

identifying element by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/ following - sibling:: tagname
